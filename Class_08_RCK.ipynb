    "# Ramsey-Cass-Koopmans (RCK) model\n",
    "\n",
    "The RCK model is an extension of the Solow-Swan model, pioneered by [Ramsey (1928)](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2224098) and extended by [Cass (1965)](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2295827) and [Koopmans (1965)](http://cowles.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/pub/d01/d0163.pdf). Known also as the Neoclassical Growth Model, it is a \"workhorse\" of modern macroeconomics and forms the basis of the majority of modern works in economic growth and business cycles literature.\n",
    "\n",
    "While in the OLG model there were an infinite number of agents (since in every new period a new generation entered the economy) and they had a finite time horizon, in the Ramsey model there is a finite number of agents with an infinite time horizon.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be justified by the following argument. In the (basic) OLG model parents are \"selfish\" and leave no assets to their children. However in the real world we see that at least some individuals leave sizeable bequests and support their children financially throughout their lives. This implies that parents care for their children's \"utility\". \n",
    "\n",
    "In the RCK model it is assumed that parents care about their children as much as they care about themselves. Therefore, each household is in fact a \"dynasty\" of individuals with an infinite planning horizon, and the welfare function of a household is constructed as follows:\n",

    "where $\\beta$ is a discount factor and $u\\left(\\cdot\\right)$ is an instantaneous utility function (felicity function).\n",
